# DiningReviewAPI-CodeCademy
This is my version of CodeCademy's Portfolio Project creating an REST API for a dining review service. I tested every endpoint thoroughly, both within the browser and cURL.
A great help were Dan Vega's videos about Spring Boot! 

The API was written using IntelliJ.

What I learned:
- General understanding of the Spring Movel-View-Controller structure.
* General undersstanding of Annotations, Beans.
* Starters/dependencies (pom.xml) and application properties.
* General understanding of CRUD, cURL.
